# Glossa

Clojure + stack-based language.

The easiest way to get started is to clone this repository and run `lein run` at its root. This obviously means you need [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed first.

```
lein run
```

This will open up a Glossa REPL. Try out the following:

```clj
glossa.core: 20

--- Data Stack:
20

glossa.core: 22

--- Data Stack:
20
22

glossa.core: : add [] (+ (GlossaStack/popIt) (GlossaStack/popIt)) ;

--- Data Stack:
20
22

glossa.core: add

--- Data Stack:
42

glossa.core: : add-2 [] 2 add ;

--- Data Stack:
42

glossa.core: add-2

--- Data Stack:
44

glossa.core: add-2 add-2

--- Data Stack:
46

glossa.core:
--- Data Stack:
48

```

## Installation

For now, just clone this repo.

## Usage

Run a REPL:

```
lein run
```
